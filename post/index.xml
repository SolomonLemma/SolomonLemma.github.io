      <description>This project was exploring the optimal predicting model for the interaction of antibody-antigens based on their proteins sequence and physicochemical properties in the use of vaccine development.
The results of multi-classification of the eye disease with its respective prevalence showed highest accuracy (98%) using XGB classifier as compared to others models. The project also achieved to identify the fundus eye images to differentiate healthy from unhealthy with a range of 85-95% accuracy level.</description>

      <title>Project: Predicting Antibody-Antigen Interaction for Vaccine Development</title>

      <description>This project was exploring the optimal predicting model for the interaction of antibody-antigens based on their proteins sequence and physicochemical properties in the use of vaccine development.
XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Deep Learning were employed to select the best performing models. The results showed that all the models performed more than 50% of the baseline. Specifically, random forest achieved about 90% accuracy with a threshold of 91% for keeping all the positive predictions.</description>
